Notes, future optimisations, to-dos:
- 01-sonar-sweep part 2, only have to compare the input exiting and
  entering the sliding window.
- TODO: learn bazel build environment + vscode debug test configuration.
- TODO: write unit tests for programs when test config is setup.
- 04-giant-squid refactor to not iterate over unneccessary bingo calls.
